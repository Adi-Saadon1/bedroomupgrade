			<li class="li"><b>Choose the Right Bed Frame</b></li>
				<p>
				Unsurprisingly, your bed is the main focal point in your bedroom, so use this as 
				a starting point to plan your redesign. Take a look at <a href="https://www.bedkingdom.co.uk/beds.html" target="_blank">these bed frames from 
				bedkingdom.co.uk</a> for inspiration and start thinking about which materials and 
				colours will work best in your room. With free delivery to most of the UK and a 
				price match guarantee, Bedkingdom makes it easy to upgrade your bedroom design 
				on any budget.<br>
				Metal bed frames can be ideal if you want a sleek, contemporary style, while 
				ottoman beds are perfect for creating extra storage. When you’re redesigning a 
				guest room, a trundle bed or ottoman bed can be used to maximise space as well 
				as creating a pleasing aesthetic.

			<li class="li"><b>Upgrade Your Furniture</b></li>
				<p>
				Once you’ve selected a bed frame, you’ll be able to decide how to upgrade your
				furniture and enjoy a seamless, cohesive design. If you’re short of space, choose
				furniture with clean lines in unobtrusive colours or materials. Too much chunky
				furniture can easily make a room feel overcrowded, so look for pieces that are
				functional and stylish without being too impactful.
				</p> <img src="img/i1.jpg"><hr>
			<li class="li"><b>Use Relaxing Colours</b></li>
				<p>
				If you want to enhance your sleep quality, choose colours and shades that are
				known for their relaxing properties. Cooler hues, such as sky blue or soft green,
				generate a feeling of calmness, which can make them a great choice in bedrooms.
				Choosing a single colour for the walls can also help to make a room feel bigger 
				than it really is, so stick to one shade if you want to create the illusion of
				space in your bedroom.
				</p><img src="img/i2.jpg"><hr>
			<li class="li"><b>Install Layered Lighting</b></li>
				<p>Changing the lighting is one of the fastest and most effective ways to upgrade
				any room. It’s easy to change the light fixtures and fittings in your bedroom but
				you’ll be surprised at the impact it can have. When you use a range of different
				lighting options to create a layered effect, you can modify the illumination at
				any time. Using wall lights and lamps creates a warmer and more peaceful
				environment than bright ceiling lights, for example.</p><img src="img/i3.jpg"><hr>
			<li class="li"><b>Inspire with Artwork & Accessories</b></li>
				<p>Hanging artwork on the walls ensures you can incorporate your favourite styles
				and trends into your bedroom décor. In addition to this, artwork can be used to
				create another focal point in the room and the right piece will draw other design
				elements together to enhance the overall aesthetic. <div style="color:rgb(240, 128, 128); font-size:21px;">
				Examples for accessories:<ul>
					<li>mirrors</li>
					<li>pictures</li>
					<li>candles</li>
					<li>plants</li>
					<li>rugs</li>
				</ul>
